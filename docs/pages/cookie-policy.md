### 1\. Introduction

Skelvy is committed to protecting your privacy. We aim to provide a trustworthy product and services so that you can focus on building meaningful connections. Our approach to privacy is to provide you with clear information about our data practices. That's why we've tried to keep legal and technical jargon to a minimum.

This document explains what cookies are, what types of cookies are placed on your device when you visit our website and how we use them. This document does not address how we deal with your personal information generally. To learn more about how we process your personal information, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://skelvy.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

### 2\. What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your device's memory. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the "lifetime" of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your devices, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using our services.

### 3\. Are there different types of cookies?

First-party and third-party cookies - first-party cookies are placed on your device directly by us. For example, we use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browser's language preferences and to better understand your use of our website. Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our partners and service providers. For example, we use third-party cookies to measure user numbers on our website.

Session and persistent cookies - session cookies only last until you close your browser. We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our website during one single browser session and to help you to use our website more efficiently. Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan and aren't automatically deleted when you close your browser. These types of cookies are primarily used to help you quickly sign in to our website again and for analytical purposes.

### 4\. What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?

Web beacons (also calls pixel tags or clear gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs) are used for similar purposes:

*   Web beacons are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our service or opened an email that we have sent them.
*   Tracking URLs are custom generated links that help us understand where the traffic to our web pages comes from.
*   SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web beacons.

For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as "cookies" in this document.

### 5\. What do we use cookies for?

Like most providers of online services, we use cookies to provide, secure and improve our services, including by remembering your preferences, recognizing you when you visit our website and personalizing and tailoring ads to your interests. To accomplish these purposes, we also may link information from cookies with other personal information we hold about you.
