Skelvy brings people together. Our community is constantly growing. We care about user safety and understand that meeting people for the first time whether online, through an acquaintance or on an outing is intriguing and exciting. However, your safety is very important and because you are in control of your Skelvy experience, there are certain safety steps that you should follow - both online and offline.

We ask you to read the tips and information below and strongly urge you to follow these guidelines in the interest of your personal safety and well-being. However, you are always the best judge of your own safety and these guidelines are not intended to be a substitute for your own judgment.

**Online Behaviour**

*   Protect your finances and never send money or financial information - never respond to any request to send money, especially overseas or via wire transfer and report it to us immediately even if the person claims to be in an emergency. The sender has no protections against loss and it's nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace the money.
*   Protect your personal information - never give personal information, such as your social security number, credit card number or bank information, your work or home address to people you don't know or haven't met in person. We will never send you an email asking for your credential information. Any such communication should be reported immediately.
*   Be web wise - block and report suspicious users. You can block and report concerns about any suspicious user at any time. Keep conversations on the platform. Bad actors will try to move the conversation to text, personal email or phone conversations.
*   Report all suspicious behaviour - additionally, please report anyone who violates our terms of service (e.g., asking for money or donations, requesting photographs, minors using the platform, users sending harassing or offensive messages, users behaving inappropriately after meeting in person, fraudulent registration or profiles, spam or solicitation).

**Offline Behaviour**

*   Get to know the other persons - keep your communications limited to the platform and really get to know users online/using the app before meeting them in person. Bad actors often push people to communicate off the platform immediately.
*   Always meet and stay in public - meet for the first time in a populated, public place. Never in a private location and never at your home or apartment.
*   Tell your friends and family members of your plans - inform them and tell where you're going. Make sure you have your phone charged and with you at all times.
*   Transport yourself to and from the meeting - you need to be independent and in control of your own transportation, especially in the case, things don't work out.
*   Be careful - avoid anything that might place you at risk. Be aware that bad actors might try to take advantage of you by altering your beverage(s) with synthetic substances.
